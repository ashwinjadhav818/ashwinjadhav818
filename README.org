I'm Ashwin — I like building, tinkering, and occasionally ranting about software, knowledge, and freedom. I don’t take myself too seriously, but I take what I *create* seriously.

I'm here to:
- Build useful, interesting, or just plain odd tools.
- Help make tech (and knowledge) a little more open and a lot more accessible.

*🛠️ What I Build (and Why)*

- **Everyday tools** – Things that *just work*. Command-line utilities, scripts, and automation tools to simplify life.
- **Learning resources** – Notes, guides, and study material for curious minds (especially mine).
- **Open knowledge** – Reformatting, translating, and archiving content that should be accessible to everyone.
- **Linux-y things** – Configs, dotfiles, and tweaks to make Linux (and Windows, when necessary) more powerful and personal.

*📌 Projects I’m proud of:*
- [[https://github.com/ashwinjadhav818/dotfiles][dotfiles]] – My personal setup for both Linux and Windows.
- [[https://github.com/ashwinjadhav818/AutoVault][AutoVault]] – A simple app to store and manage information about your car(s).
- [[https://github.com/ashwinjadhav818/obsidian-aura][obsidian-aura]] – A clean, minimal, and customizable Obsidian theme.

*💭 Things I Believe:*
- Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) matters.
- Emacs > Vim (still figuring it out).
- Terminal > GUI (well... most of the time).
